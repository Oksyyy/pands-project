# Programming And Scripting
by Oksana Abrosimova

This repository contains Progect materials related to the **Programming And Sripting** study module. To demonstrate learning and understanding of the core Python concepts learned throughout the programm, the analysis.py program was written providing analysis of the famous Iris data set.

## Dataset
At a high level, the Iris dataset contains measurements of three Iris flower species. 

It includes 150 rows and 5 columns: 
- Four columns hold numerical measurements of flower features:
    - sepal length (cm)
    - sepal width (cm)
    - petal length (cm) 
    - petal width (cm)
- The fifth column contains categorical data representing the class (species) of each flower: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.

Each row in the dataset represents one flower sample, shoing its four measurements and a corresponding class. There are 50 samples per each Iris species.

## Required Software

- Python - Programming language required to run the code. Download from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Jupyter - An environment for writing and running code, exploring, analysing and visualising data. For installation refer to [Jupiter documenation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/install.html).
- Codespaces (alternative to Jupyter) -  A cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub that allows running Jupyter Notebooks. Available in the repository under "Code" drop-down menu. 

## Required Packages

All necessary packages are imported and explained within the notebook. Here's a quick overview:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html): used to load the Iris dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/): used for numerical operations and data array manipulations.
- [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/): used for creating plots and visualisations.
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html): used for creating plots and visualisations.
